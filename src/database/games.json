Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself.",

    "Description":"Free Demo Available Here A free-roaming squad based RPG focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals. Research new equipment and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh desert. Train your men up from puny victims to master warriors. Carry your wounded squad mates to safety and get them all home alive. Features Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world in the largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870 square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict your personal play style. Custom design as many characters as you want and build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their appearance too. Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre. No 'hero' characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a life. You are not the chosen one. You're not great and powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it. Build a base where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. Purchase and upgrade your own buildings to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. Variation and possibilities of gameplay. Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. Dynamic, ever changing world. Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a 'game', you are living and surviving in a simulated world. Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive , or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. Absolutely no Level-scaling. The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. Realistic medical system that affects gameplay. A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character\u2019s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. Intelligent AI that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. Aid or oppose the various factions in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. Independently developed with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. Original game world. There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.",

Key Features: All-New Characters and All-New Classes: Four all new playable classes including the Siren, the Commando, the Gunzerker and the Assassin. Step into the role of the Gunzerker, whose highly deadly skills allow him to dual-wield any two weapons found in the game.

Sure, if that\u2019s your thing! Want to try other styles? More tactical perhaps? There are multiple classes to choose from! Dynamic Co-op online, and LAN: Share your adventures with friends both online and via LAN.

Now, the villainous Wilhelm Ehrenburg takes front and center stage, his night of bloodstained roses painting a crimson tale of action and despair. The setting of this gripping story? The final months of World War II. Features the return of 'Dies irae ~Amantes amentes~' writer Takashi Masada and artist G Yuusuke. \uff1cSTORY\uff1e 'My mother was my sister.' Brooklyn, New York - The man who sat across the interviewer at the vampire bar known as the 'Borges House' began his story with those odd words. Following the end World War II, the pallid SS officer traversed the globe to many a raging battlefield, leaving carnage unforeseen in his wake. The vampire of the battlefield. The wandering Hakenkreuz. Though his saga was passed down as naught but a stale ghost story, it was no mere urban legend. For he was Wilhelm Ehrenburg - hunted in absolute secrecy by the UN as a remnant of the Third Reich, enemy of the world, and one of the infamous members of the demonic Longinus Dreizehn Orden. And after over half a century, the time had finally come for him to depart for Japan in order to fulfill his most ardent desire. Humoring this interviewer he would have ignored or slain any other day was merely a whim birthed from the exaltation of the promised time drawing ever closer. That was the only reason our intrepid interviewer found him in a talkative mood. Thus, as he reflected on his life, Wilhelm grew nostalgic - sentimental, even - for the path he had walked. And when asked, he unveiled his past piece by piece. From the accursed blood that poisoned his very soul, to the blight wrought by the works of Mercury. He spun a tale of the day he awakened to the truth of his being, and of the woman who had the nature of Wilhelm's existence engraved upon her very being. 'Don't you worry, I'm gonna tell you everything. From the first moment I met her, to the very end of our story.' \uff1cGame Features\uff1e All new side story in the universe of 'Dies irae ~Amantes amentes~', starring Wilhelm Ehrenburg.

These are the star types discovered so far: Yellow Stars As the most stable star type, the Yellow Star offers a perfect setting to establish your permanent presence and plan your Empire's long term economy. All new players start in their own Yellow Star system and over time expand to discover and colonize more planets, set mining patterns, establish trade routes and neutralize the mysterious alien ships found throughout the Hades galaxy. As the owner of a Yellow Star system, you have complete control over what other players have access to it. By establishing diplomatic relations, you can allow any other player to send ships to your system, and dictate your own terms for mining, trade or military cooperation. Red Stars Very early in the game, every player will build a Red Star Scanner, a station that allows them to jump ships to detected Red Stars. These stars have a small lifetime and will go supernova after 15 minutes. The goal in the Red Star is to co-operate with any other players that have ships in that star system, defeat the NPC ships, retrieve Artifacts from the Red Star planets, and jump back before the Supernova. Artifacts can be researched in the home star and will yield necessary resources for trade, mining and combat advancements. Higher level Red Stars offer more challenging enemies and better rewards. White Stars Players can organize in Corporations. Besides helping each other, Corporations can also scan for White Stars. A White Star sees up to 40 players from two Corporations battle in the same star system for Relics, a resource that can be retrieved to upgrade the Corporation and give each member additional benefits. Time passes by very slowly in White Stars: every match lasts for 5 days, giving Corporation members time to talk and coordinate their strategy. The Time Machine can be used to plan future moves, communicate them to other Corporation members, and see potential outcomes of future combat. Blue Stars These short lived stars only last for 5 minutes, during which the entire system is collapsing on itself. Each player can only send a single Battleship to the Blue Star. The 5 participating players combat each other, using their ship's modules and other NPC ships to destroy the other player ships and be the last one alive. Blue Stars offer the fastest PvP action in the game. Regular participants receive daily and monthly rewards to advance their Empire.",

By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies. The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him. The intense, real-time gameplay of Half-Life 2 is made possible only by Source&reg;, Valve's new proprietary engine technology. Source provides major enhancements in: Characters: Advanced facial animation system delivers the most sophisticated in-game characters ever seen. With 40 distinct facial muscles, human characters convey the full array of human emotion, and respond to the player with fluidity and intelligence. Physics: From pebbles to water to 2-ton trucks respond as expected, as they obey the laws of mass, friction, gravity, and buoyancy. Graphics: Source's shader-based renderer, like the one used at Pixar to create movies such as Toy Story&reg; and Monster's, Inc.&reg;, creates the most beautiful and realistic environments ever seen in a video game. AI: Neither friends nor enemies charge blindly into the fray. They can assess threats, navigate tricky terrain, and fashion weapons from whatever is at hand.",

She\u2019s, well... kind of troublesome personality. Likes: Her S.O.\/producer, \u201cP-chan\u201d; psychotropics. OMGkawaiiAngel: An \u201cinternet angel\u201d.

Let's do all kinds of things from afternoon to evening to find out hot topics for streaming. Sometimes you just need to take a little break because streaming can be stressful. Take Ame on dates, serve her up a little bit of naughtiness once in awhile, provide her with a little something-something to take the edge off when she needs to release some pent-up stress, and use social media to grumble about to help keep her happy and mentally healthy. But be careful. Depending on your actions, she might increase her 'sickness level' and be swallowed by the darkness of the Internet! *NOTE: This is a perfectly wholesome game, containing absolutely no explicit sexual references or expressions nor illegal substances. For real! You can see the results of your daily actions and behavior via social media, where Ame-chan will use both public and private accounts to talk about you. People have a tendency to act supportive and friendly on the outside, while talking loads of smack and spreading rumors privately. \u25a0You'll get a variety of messages every day! Let's reply back to them with stickers. Ignoring messages is not a human thing to do. Don't make her angry. You\u2019ll sometimes receive long-winded, tedious criticisms and insults, but that\u2019s just par for the course when dealing with a cute girl streaming on the internet. Be sure to take proper care of her. \u25a0The game features multiple endings! Your streamer will do things like become weird and emo for various reasons, subject her trusty P-chan to harm, and generally get messed up in the head.

Experience enhanced combat where the combination of heroic prowess and ingenious traps leads to unparalleled orc destruction. Engage in tighter, more responsive third-person shooter and melee combat. Enjoy crazier physics-based interactions and more ridiculous ragdoll effects. Watch with joy as your traps hurl, crush, slice, and incinerate orcs in spectacular fashion. Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap stays true to the beloved humor, personality, and charm of the series. From witty orc chatter to over-the-top physics sending screaming orcs flying, and a strong guitar- and drum-heavy soundtrack, every moment is crafted to keep your adrenaline pumping.",

Path of Exile 2 takes place in the land of Wraeclast, a dark continent populated by unique cultures, ancient secrets, and monstrous dangers. A sinister threat, long thought destroyed, has begun creeping back on the edge of civilisation, driving people mad and sickening the land with Corruption. Path of Exile 2 features a brand new campaign with six acts, 100 distinct environments, 600 monsters and 100 bosses. Key Features Twelve Character Classes Path of Exile 2 features twelve character classes, two for every combination of Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence. While each of the class variants focuses on a different playstyle, they're just a starting point. You can combine skills from many classes together to create your ideal character build. Each of the twelve character classes has its own three Ascendancy specialisations, resulting in a total of 36 Ascendancy Classes to pick between. New Skill Gem System Path of Exile 2 features 240 Skill Gems that grant devastating active skills and 200 Support Gems that modify their behaviour. Combine these together to create your perfect build. This is the next generation of Path of Exile's famous skill system. Support Gems are now socketed directly into Skill Gems, removing many of the frustrations present in the old system while maintaining all the previous depth. It's now possible to six-link every skill your character uses. Dual-specialise your Passive Skill Tree Path of Exile's iconic Passive Skill Tree has made a return, with 1,500 skills that allow you to completely customise your gameplay experience. It now features Dual Specialisation, the ability to allocate some passive skill points to two different sets of skills. They engage whenever the appropriate weapon or skill type is used. For example, you can have some points allocated to both daggers and traps, or ice and lightning, and as you swap between attacks, the appropriate skill points will apply. This lets you specialise in multiple areas without opportunity cost. Uncover All-new Items Path of Exile 2 features 700 equipment base types and every single one has its own unique item you can find. You can augment your arsenal with new weapons such as Spears, Crossbows and Flails, as well as supplementary items like Focuses, Traps and redesigned Sceptres. Encounter Unique Bosses In Path of Exile 2, every area of the Campaign contains a boss encounter. There's over a hundred bosses to fight as you make your way through the Acts and they all have unique mechanics to learn. Explore a New Endgame Completing the campaign is just the beginning. The endgame in Path of Exile 2 includes countless areas in different biomes, powerful crafting, challenging bosses, unique encounters and much more. Unlock new paths and explore further into the world.\u00a0 As you progress through the endgame, you will gain access to special passive trees that can boost the rewards of your maps and change the way the various endgame mechanics work. These trees will make your maps more rewarding but also more difficult. Path of Exile 2 introduces sequels to several leagues from Path of Exile. While their mechanics are familiar, the monsters, bosses, rewards and progression are all new. Fair-To-Play. Never Pay-To-Win. Path of Exile 2 is a separate game to the original Path of Exile.
